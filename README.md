# sum-game

Welcome to **Sum Game**, a logic-based number game where you interact with a square board by circling or crossing out numbers. Your goal is to ensure that the **sum of circled numbers** in each **row**, **column**, and **highlighted group** matches a given target value. Based on the 'Number Sums' game by EasyBrain.

## 🧩 How to Play

- The game consists of a square grid filled with numbers.
- Some cells are **highlighted**—these represent special groups.
- You can either:
  - ✅ **Circle** a number to include it in the sum (left click).
  - ❌ **Cross** a number to exclude it from the sum (right click).
- Your objective is to **circle and cross numbers** such that:
  - The **sum of circled numbers** in each **row** equals the row-target.
  - The **sum of circled numbers** in each **column** equals the column-target.
  - The **sum of circled numbers** in each **highlighted group** equals the group-target.

## 💡 Hint Feature

Need a nudge? The game includes a **Hint** button that provides logical suggestions based on the current board state.

### How It Works:
- When clicked, the hint system analyzes which cells must or cannot be part of the solution based on current selections
- A hint may suggest a cell to circle or cross and explain **why** the suggestion makes sense

This helps sharpen your logic skills while keeping the challenge engaging.
